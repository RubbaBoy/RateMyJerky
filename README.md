# Rate My Jerky
Rate My Jerky is a hackathon project for Clayhack. This solves the problem of not being sure what the best beef jerky is, or the best place to get beef jerky at RIT. There are half a dozen locations (not including all vending machines) to get beef jerky, and with a high price mark, it often leaves students puzzles and worried, not being sure where their next source of good beef jerky is going to come from.

Rate My Jerky is a mobile app that allows you to simply scan your beef jerky barcode, give a name, location, and star rating/description of your jerky experience to publish to the master list of beef jerky reviews. Everyone's reviews can then be viewed by a location filter, or all locations at once if you are really looking out for the best jerky. With a light/dark theme toggle, you can't go wrong.
